## ðŸ’¡ Our Idea

**Problem:** Many elderly dementia patients struggle to remember people and events, impacting their independence and burdening caregivers. Current assistants lack personalized memory support.

**Solution:** RecallBridge is a voice-enabled AI assistant that uses generative AI and multimodal data (contacts, photos, call logs, wearables) to help patients recall memories naturally through voice and images.

**Generative AI:** LLMs understand queries and generate empathetic responses; AI models support image recognition and voice interaction for easy, personalized use.

**Impact:** Improves quality of life for dementia patients and eases caregiver load. Scalable for millions, addressing a critical public health issue in India and beyond.
